      The building has several architectural elements pointing to its original construction as a farm house:
      A large living room with a fire-place, a living room with a central stone-built arch, a stable, a stone-built stair with decorations, and an inner yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/YGke1QM6v1DMxKr18" target="_blank">located</a> in the centre of the original village of Agios Athanasios, adjacent to the town house and the square at its front.
    </p>
    <p>
      The building was constructed in phases, from middle to late 19th century. The north-facing entrance was added in 1891 as it is shown by the stone inscription at its top.
